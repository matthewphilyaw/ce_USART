This project is based on Contextual Eelectornics course that brings up a the U\+S\+A\+RT peripheral on S\+T\+M32 micro.

In this specific example the board I have is a Nucleo F446\+ZE and this particular project implements a dead simple \char`\"{}serial interface\char`\"{}.

The board is setup to run at a 115200 buadrate and is essentially an echo server with the following characters additionally toggling leds


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 1 -\/$>$ Toggles Green Led on board
\item 2 -\/$>$ Toggles Blue Led on board
\item 3 -\/$>$ Toggles Red Led on board
\end{DoxyItemize}

On boot the board will will setup the Initialize all the device and then print a header out to the U\+S\+A\+RT 3 device that includes the firmware and hardware version along with the date compiled.

It\textquotesingle{}s basic but a start.
